# ABOUT ME
Analytical thinking has always been my "DNA". After more than 10 years of professional experience I decided in autumn 2022 to further my education even more in line with my talents: Since then, I have acquired a variety of relevant skills in different practical data projects: I am proficient in data manipulation, analysis and visualization as well as ML model building, using technologies such as Python, SQL, Tableau and more.

These skills complement my background as an Account and Campaign Manager and my extensive practical experience in developing and implementing changing projects from start to finish as well as professionally communicating with internal and external stakeholders.

# PROJECTS

## [Analyzing Music Data](https://github.com/scheinmensch/Spotify)

#### Python | API | Custom visualizations | Word clouds | Clustering | Spotipy | Seaborn | Matplotlib | Plotly | Scikit-learn

In this project I analyze music data that I received via the Spotify Web API. Special highlights of this project are the use of the Spotipy package, the customized visualizations, the creation of word clouds and the use of Plotly to create interactive graphics.

## [Tanzania Tourism Prediction](https://github.com/scheinmensch/Tanzania_Tourism_Prediction)

#### Python | Clustering | Seaborn | Matplotlib | Scikit-learn | XGBoost

In this project I carried out a comprehensive analysis of tourist data. It also includes a cluster analysis with KModes. Furthermore, I created a machine learning model that predicts how much a tourist will spend in Tanzania. The final model was a XGB regressor. My results put me in a good 27th rank in the Zindi Challenge.

## [Plänterwaldlauf Analysis](https://github.com/scheinmensch/Plaenterwaldlauf)

#### Python | Camelot | Seaborn | Matplotlib

In this project I analyze data from the 91st Plänterwaldlauf, in which I myself took part. The biggest challenge in this project was that the data was only available as tables in various PDFs. With the help of Camelot and a lot of manual work, I created a structured data set that was easy to work with.

## [HR Analytics](https://github.com/scheinmensch/HR-Analytics)

#### Python | Seaborn | Matplotlib | Scikit-learn | XGBoost | Sampling

The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a candidate is looking for a job change or not. First, of course, I carried out a comprehensive EDA. The data was very poor, but my model still performs very solidly compared to others on Kaggle.

## [Infringement Detection](https://github.com/scheinmensch/Infringement_Detection_on_Airbnb)

#### Python | Webscraping | Custom visualizations | Presentation | Clustering | Seaborn | Matplotlib | Beautifulsoup | Selenium | Scikit-learn

This is our final project at the neuefische Data Practitioner bootcamp. Together with 2 fellow students, we compared Airbnb data from 3 European cities. We paid particular attention to the question of whether applicable laws and restrictions on subletting apartments were violated in the cities. For the city of Barcelona, we trained a machine learning model that correctly classifies 99% of all listings - whether they seem compliant or suspicious. Another highlight of this project is that we partially scraped the data used ourselves.

## [Financial Inclusion in Africa](https://github.com/scheinmensch/Financial_inclusion_in_Africa)

#### Python | Presentation | Clustering | Seaborn | Matplotlib | Plotly | Scikit-learn | XGBoost | Sampling

My first machine learning project. The aim was to use demographic data of some inhabitants of Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda to predict whether these people have a bank account or not. With the final model (XGBoost Classifier), I was able to improve the recall score from 0.42 to 0.83 (compared to the baseline model).
