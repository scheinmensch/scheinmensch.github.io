# PROJECTS

## [Analyzing Music Data](https://github.com/scheinmensch/Spotify)

In this project I analyze music data that I received via the Spotify Web API. Special highlights of this project are the use of the Spotipy package, the customized visualizations, the creation of word clouds and the use of Plotly to create interactive graphics.

## [Tanzania Tourism Prediction](https://github.com/scheinmensch/Tanzania_Tourism_Prediction)

In this project I carried out a comprehensive analysis of tourist data. It also includes a cluster analysis with KModes. Furthermore, I created a machine learning model that predicts how much a tourist will spend in Tanzania. The final model was a XGB regressor.

## [Plänterwaldlauf Analysis](https://github.com/scheinmensch/Plaenterwaldlauf)

In this project I analyze data from the 91st Plänterwaldlauf, in which I myself took part. The biggest challenge in this project was that the data was only available as tables in various PDFs. With the help of Camelot and a lot of manual work, I created a structured data set that was easy to work with.

## [HR Analytics](https://github.com/scheinmensch/HR-Analytics)

The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a candidate is looking for a job change or not. First, of course, I carried out a comprehensive EDA.

## [Infringement Detection](https://github.com/scheinmensch/Infringement_Detection_on_Airbnb)

This is our final project at the neuefische Data Practitioner bootcamp. Together with 2 fellow students, we compared Airbnb data from 3 European cities. We paid particular attention to the question of whether applicable laws and restrictions on subletting apartments were violated in the cities. For the city of Barcelona, we trained a machine learning model that correctly classifies 99% of all listings - whether they seem compliant or suspicious. Another highlight of this project is that we partially scraped the data used ourselves.
