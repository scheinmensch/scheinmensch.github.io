# ABOUT ME
## Data Analyst | Data Scientist

### SKILLS
Python | SQL | Tableau

*Analytical thinking has always been my "DNA". After more than 10 years of professional experience in various industries, most recently in UGC-Marketing, I decided in autumn 2022 to educate myself better according to my talents: I trained as a Data Practitioner in an intensive coding bootcamp. In this role, I see myself as a data all-rounder who can be used for everything from preparing data, comprehensive analysis including visualization, to creating predictive models. The latter became my special passion.*

*With Python, SQL, Tableau and others I already master the relevant technologies, but I also quickly get to grips with new tools. Lifelong learning is not only natural for me as an employee, but also corresponds to my inner need for personal development.*

*I have years of experience in independently developing and implementing projects from start to finish. I don't shy away from the responsibility that comes with it, and I don't need much motivation from outside. Nevertheless, I also feel extremely comfortable in strong teams.*

*My diverse background and wide-ranging interests allow me to think outside the box. Whoever hires me not only gets my manpower for the contractually agreed hours, but also rents a place in my mind. The best solutions and ideas do not always come to me in front of the computer, but also often on the running track or while cooking.*
